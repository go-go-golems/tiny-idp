`xgoja/v2` is the native configuration schema for planner-backed xgoja builds.
It describes provider packages, selected Go-backed runtime modules,
goja-executed source sets, command surfaces, generated artifacts, and local Go
workspace behavior.

The planner renders generated binaries and runtime packages around a v2-native
`app.RuntimePlan` (`schema: xgoja/runtime/v2`). That runtime plan is the active
runtime contract: `providers`, `runtime.modules`, unified `sources`, `commands`,
and `artifacts` are authoritative.

The central rule is simple and strict: xgoja compiles or bundles code that runs
inside goja. Browser applications, frontend bundles, workers, and other
non-goja JavaScript outputs should be built by their own tools and included as
asset directories.

## Minimal binary

```yaml
schema: xgoja/v2
name: fixture

app:
  name: fixture

go:
  module: xgoja.generated/fixture
  version: "1.26"

workspace:
  mode: auto

providers:
  - id: core
    import: github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/core

runtime:
  modules:
    - provider: core
      name: path
      as: path

commands:
  - id: run
    type: builtin.run
    name: run

artifacts:
  - id: binary
    type: binary
    output: dist/fixture
```

Validate and build it with:

```bash
xgoja doctor -f xgoja.yaml
xgoja build -f xgoja.yaml --output dist/fixture
```

## Top-level fields

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | Must be `xgoja/v2` for native v2 files. |
| `name` | Application/spec name. Defaults are derived from this name when possible. |
| `app` | Runtime application identity and config-file options. |
| `go` | Generated Go module settings and extra generated imports. |
| `workspace` | Local Go module resolution behavior. |
| `providers` | Go packages that contribute xgoja capabilities. |
| `runtime.modules` | Go-backed CommonJS modules selected into the runtime. |
| `sources` | Source sets for jsverbs, scripts, help, and assets. |
| `commands` | User-facing command surfaces. |
| `artifacts` | Generated outputs such as binaries and declaration files. |
| `profiles` | Optional profile overrides. Current support is intentionally small. |

## Application identity

```yaml
app:
  name: my-tool
  envPrefix: MY_TOOL
  configFile:
    enabled: true
    layers: [system, user, project]
    fileName: my-tool.yaml
```

`app.name` is the generated application identity. `app.envPrefix` is used for
environment-variable backed command fields. `app.configFile` enables the
existing Glazed config-file integration in generated commands.

## Go module settings

```yaml
go:
  module: xgoja.generated/my-tool
  version: "1.26"
  tags: [sqlite]
  ldflags: ["-s", "-w"]
  env:
    CGO_ENABLED: "1"
  imports:
    - import: github.com/acme/project/internal/xgoja/extra
      module: github.com/acme/project
      version: v0.3.0
```

`go.module` is the module path for generated build workspaces. `go.version`
defaults to `1.26`. `go.imports` adds extra Go imports required by generated
hosts. When `go.imports[].module` is omitted, xgoja infers the module root from
the import path.

## Workspace resolution

```yaml
workspace:
  mode: auto # auto | off | path
  file: ../../go.work
```

Workspace planning is build-time behavior. It does not enter the generated
runtime plan.

- `auto` searches upward from the spec directory for `go.work` and uses matching
  local modules.
- `off` ignores `go.work` and uses versions or explicit replacements only.
- `path` uses `workspace.file` explicitly.

Resolution precedence is:

1. explicit provider module replacement;
2. CLI replacement such as `--xgoja-replace`;
3. matching local module from `go.work`;
4. versioned module requirement.

`xgoja doctor` reports module-resolution rows so you can inspect the selected
module path, local directory, version, resolution kind, and source before build.

## Providers

```yaml
providers:
  - id: http
    import: github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/http
    register: Register
    module:
      version: v0.1.0
      replace: ../go-go-goja
```

A provider is a Go package that registers xgoja capabilities. It can contribute
Go-backed runtime modules, command sets, jsverb sources, TypeScript descriptors,
help sources, assets, host services, and runtime initializers.

`id` is the local spec identifier used by `runtime.modules`, `sources`, and
`commands`. `import` is the Go package import path. `register` defaults to
`Register`. `module.version` and `module.replace` control generated `go.mod`
requirements when workspace resolution does not provide a better local module.

## Runtime modules

```yaml
runtime:
  modules:
    - provider: http
      name: express
      as: express
      config:
        listen: 127.0.0.1:8787
        dev-errors: false
        reject-raw-routes: true
```

Runtime modules are Go-backed CommonJS modules. JavaScript or TypeScript source
imports them with `require("express")` or an equivalent compiled import. Provider-specific `config` maps are parsed by that provider; unknown fields are rejected when the provider exposes an xgoja config section.

For `go-go-goja-http` / `express`, the first supported static config fields are:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Start the xgoja-owned HTTP server when Express registers routes. |
| `listen` | Listen address for the xgoja-owned HTTP server. |
| `dev-errors` | Return development JavaScript handler error details from the internal `gojahttp` host. Keep `false` for production. |
| `reject-raw-routes` | Reject matched raw/unplanned routes; planned `.public()`/`.auth()` routes and static mounts still work. |

The planner derives runtime module aliases from `runtime.modules`. TypeScript
source sets do not need to repeat those aliases under a separate `external`
field. During bundling, xgoja preserves those imports so the Go-backed module is
resolved by the goja runtime.

## Sources

A source set is a named group of files. It has a kind, an origin, optional
filters, language metadata, and optional compile intent.

```yaml
sources:
  - id: local-sites
    kind: jsverbs
    from:
      dir: ./verbs
    include: ["**/*.ts"]
    exclude: ["**/*.test.ts"]
    extensions: [.ts]
    language: typescript
    compile:
      mode: runtime
      bundle: true
```

### Source kinds

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `jsverbs` | JavaScript or TypeScript files scanned for jsverb command metadata. |
| `script` | Goja-executed script source for run/runtime planning. |
| `help` | Help markdown source files. |
| `assets` | Static asset files. Build frontend/browser outputs outside xgoja, then include them as assets. |

### Source origins

Disk directory:

```yaml
from:
  dir: ./verbs
```

Provider-shipped source:

```yaml
from:
  provider:
    provider: docs
    source: bundled-help
```

Workspace module source:

```yaml
from:
  workspace:
    module: github.com/acme/project
    path: internal/xgoja/verbs
```

Workspace origins require the module to resolve to a local directory.

### Static import graph validation

Executable source sets (`jsverbs` and `script`) are parsed during planning so xgoja can validate local helper imports and runtime module aliases before generating a binary. The source graph accepts standard JavaScript, ESM, TypeScript, and TSX static imports, including:

```js
const assets = require("fs:assets")
import express from "express"
import "./setup"
export { helper } from "./helper"
await import("./dynamic")
```

Bare specifiers must match a selected `runtime.modules[].name` or `runtime.modules[].as` alias. Aliases may contain punctuation such as `fs:assets`; use the literal alias in source code rather than hiding it behind string concatenation.

Non-literal dynamic imports are rejected because generated xgoja apps require a closed static source graph:

```js
// Avoid: sourcegraph cannot validate this dependency statically.
require(["fs", "assets"].join(":"))
```

### TypeScript compile intent

```yaml
language: typescript
compile:
  mode: runtime
  bundle: true
  define:
    __DEV__: "false"
  check:
    command: ["npx", "tsc", "--noEmit"]
```

`mode: runtime` means the generated runtime compiles the source before goja
loads it. `bundle: true` lets TypeScript files import local helpers such as
`./helper`. Provider and embedded TypeScript sources are bundled from their
`fs.FS` root; they do not need to be copied to disk for local helper resolution.

xgoja owns the normal goja compiler profile. Do not put browser or Node bundler
settings such as platform, format, target, package-manager installation, CSS
loaders, or polyfills in v2 source config.

## Commands

Commands are explicit surfaces. Generated runtimes store built-in commands and provider command sets in the same ordered `commands[]` list.

```yaml
commands:
  - id: run
    type: builtin.run
    name: run

  - id: verbs
    type: builtin.jsverbs
    name: verbs
    sources: [local-sites]

  - id: serve
    type: provider.command-set
    provider: http
    name: serve
    mount: serve
    sources: [local-sites]
```

Supported builtin command types are:

- `builtin.eval`
- `builtin.run`
- `builtin.repl`
- `builtin.jsverbs`

`provider.command-set` mounts a command set contributed by a selected provider.
Provider command sets commonly depend on source sets. For example, the HTTP
`serve` provider command uses jsverb sources to register Express routes.

`commands[].sources` is command-scoped. Provider commands receive a
`SourceRegistry` containing only the declared source IDs, and should read sources
through `ctx.Sources`. HTTP `serve` uses that scoped registry for jsverb command
discovery, hot reload rescans, and default watch roots.

Runtime modules and provider command sets are separate provider outputs. A
runtime module is selected under `runtime.modules` and is imported by JavaScript
code. A command set is selected under `commands` and contributes CLI commands.
The HTTP provider demonstrates the distinction: `express` is the runtime module,
while `serve` is a provider command set that runs a jsverb long enough for the
registered HTTP routes to serve traffic.

The `mount` field on a command controls where the command appears in the
generated CLI command tree. It does not mount an HTTP handler. HTTP handler
mounting happens at runtime through the Express module, for example
`app.mount("/ws", handlerObject)`, or through provider host-service integration.

## Artifacts

Artifacts describe generated outputs.

```yaml
artifacts:
  - id: binary
    type: binary
    output: dist/my-tool
    sources: [local-sites]

  - id: declarations
    type: dts
    output: js/types/xgoja-modules.d.ts
    strict: true

  - id: public-assets
    type: embedded-assets
    sources: [web-dist]
```

Common artifact types are:

| Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `binary` | Generated xgoja binary. When `sources` lists local jsverb/help source sets, those sources are copied into the generated embedded filesystem. |
| `dts` | TypeScript declaration output for selected runtime modules. |
| `embedded-assets` | Static assets embedded into the generated host. |
| `runtime-package` | Generated runtime package output exposing `EmbeddedRuntimePlanJSON`, `DecodeRuntimePlan`, `NewBundle`, and `Bundle.NewRuntime`. |
| `adapter`, `cobra`, `source`, `template` | Additional generated output shapes consumed through the v2 plan-backed generator. |

For binary/runtime-package style artifacts, `sources` marks local jsverb and
help source sets that should be copied into the generated embedded filesystem.
For assets, use a separate `embedded-assets` artifact with `sources` pointing at
asset source IDs.

Generated hosts can configure Go-owned auth services with a top-level `auth:`
block. `app.NewHostWithOptions` installs a lazy `hostauth.ServiceFactoryKey`
from the runtime plan, and the HTTP `serve` provider builds concrete
session/store/auth services at command execution time. Runtime-package hosts may
still override that factory through `NewBundle` and `Options.ConfigureServices`,
but the common generated-binary path does not need a hand-written Go shell.

```yaml
auth:
  mode: oidc
  session:
    cookie:
      allow-insecure-http: false
  stores:
    default:
      driver: postgres
      dsn: postgres://user:pass@postgres:5432/app?sslmode=disable
      apply-schema: true
  oidc:
    issuer-url: https://auth.example.test/realms/demo
    client-id: demo-app
    public-base-url: https://demo.example.test
```

The HTTP `serve` commands expose an `auth` Glazed section whenever the host has a
`hostauth.ServiceFactoryKey`. The CLI surface is flat and prefixed with
`--auth-`; Glazed can then source the same fields from flags, config files, or
environment according to the generated application's normal middleware setup.
The nested `hostauth.Config` remains the YAML/default shape, while command-time
settings arrive through parsed `*values.Values`:

```bash
generated-oidc-host-auth serve sites demo \
  --auth-mode oidc \
  --auth-default-store-driver postgres \
  --auth-default-store-dsn "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --auth-oidc-issuer-url https://auth.example.test/realms/demo \
  --auth-oidc-client-id demo-app \
  --auth-oidc-client-secret "$OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  --auth-oidc-public-base-url https://demo.example.test
```

`public-base-url` is the normal deployment setting; the callback defaults to
`<public-base-url>/auth/callback`. Use `redirect-url` only as an advanced
override when the callback does not follow that convention. The auth resolver
does not read environment variables directly and no longer supports `dsn-env`.
Keep DSNs and secrets in the Glazed input layer rather than committed generated
YAML. Cookie defaults are secure (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`,
`Path=/`); set `--auth-session-cookie-allow-insecure-http` only for localhost
HTTP smoke tests. Application authorization remains app-owned Go (`appauth`,
domain services, or a future policy engine), not a YAML policy DSL.


A `template` artifact is a code-generation output shape. It should not be used
to model runtime behavior such as HTTP serving, WebSocket mounting, or provider
module setup. Runtime behavior belongs in provider packages, runtime modules,
command sets, and host services.

Template-generated hosts still benefit from `CommandSetContext.Host`. If a
template emits a host that attaches provider command sets, those commands receive
the same host service bag as modules: embedded asset lookup, `ConfigureServices`
injections, shared HTTP hosts, and other provider-defined services. Template
code should therefore construct commands through `app.NewHost` /
`app.NewHostWithOptions` instead of bypassing xgoja command-set attachment and
reimplementing asset or service plumbing.

`xgoja gen-dts` uses the first `type: dts` artifact as its default output when `--out` is omitted; `strict: true` on the artifact enables strict declaration checks.

## TypeScript jsverbs example

```yaml
schema: xgoja/v2
name: typescript-jsverbs

providers:
  - id: http
    import: github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/http

runtime:
  modules:
    - provider: http
      name: express

sources:
  - id: sites
    kind: jsverbs
    from:
      dir: ./verbs
    language: typescript
    compile:
      mode: runtime
      bundle: true

commands:
  - id: verbs
    type: builtin.jsverbs
    sources: [sites]

  - id: serve
    type: provider.command-set
    provider: http
    name: serve
    mount: serve
    sources: [sites]

artifacts:
  - id: binary
    type: binary
    output: dist/typescript-jsverbs
    sources: [sites]
```

A verb in `./verbs/site.ts` can import a local helper and the selected runtime
module:

```ts
import { message } from "./message"
import express from "express"

__package__({ name: "sites" })
__verb__("demo", { name: "demo", output: "text" })
export function demo() {
  const app = express.app()
  app.get("/", (_req, res) => res.send(message()))
}
```

The local helper import is bundled. The `express` import is externalized because
it is a selected runtime module alias.

Go-backed modules can also expose mountable HTTP handlers. Express can mount
those handlers while JavaScript remains the composition layer:

```ts
import express from "express"
import sessionstream from "sessionstream"

__package__({ name: "sites" })
__verb__("site", { name: "site", output: "text" })
export function site() {
  const app = express.app()
  const hub = sessionstream.hub({ schemas })

  app.get("/healthz", (_req, res) => res.send("ok"))
  app.mount("/ws", sessionstream.webSocket.server(hub))
}
```

The mounted object must carry the shared `gojahttp` hidden `http.Handler` ref.
This is how a Go-backed transport such as a WebSocket server can be mounted
without reimplementing upgrade handling in JavaScript.

Express route patterns and mounted handlers use different matching semantics:

- `app.get("/users/:id", ...)` captures one segment as `req.params.id`.
- `app.get("/assets/*", ...)` matches the rest of the path but does not expose a splat capture today.
- `app.mount("/ws", handler)` uses prefix matching and gives the request to the Go handler.

`app.mount()` is intentionally not a JavaScript parameter/wildcard router. Mount Go-backed transports at a stable prefix and let the Go handler do any detailed matching by reading `r.URL.Path` or by delegating to its own router. For example, a mounted WebSocket handler can use the Go standard library mux and path values:

```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("GET /ws/rooms/{roomID}", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    roomID := r.PathValue("roomID")
    serveRoomSocket(w, r, roomID)
})
```

This keeps JavaScript responsible for composition and keeps Go responsible for Go-owned HTTP routing and WebSocket upgrade behavior.

## Troubleshooting

### Provider command does not see a jsverb

Check `commands[].sources`. Provider command sets see only the source IDs listed
on the command. For HTTP serve, use this shape:

```yaml
commands:
  - id: http-serve
    type: provider.command-set
    provider: http
    name: serve
    mount: serve
    sources: [local-sites]
```

Then verify the generated command and flags:

```bash
xgoja build -f xgoja.yaml --output dist/app
./dist/app serve sites demo --help --long-help
./dist/app serve sites demo --http-listen 127.0.0.1:8787
```

### CLI mount vs HTTP mount

`commands[].mount` controls the CLI tree, for example whether provider commands
appear under `serve`. It does not mount an HTTP handler. HTTP mounting happens
inside JavaScript route code with Express APIs such as `app.mount("/ws", handler)`.

### Local provider replacement is stale

Prefer `workspace.mode: auto` when the repository has a `go.work` containing the
provider module. `xgoja doctor` reports the selected module resolution source so
you can confirm whether the build uses a workspace module, CLI replacement, or
versioned dependency.

## Current limits

The normal command path is v2-plan-native: `doctor`, `build`, `generate`, `gen-dts`, and `list-modules` load `schema: xgoja/v2`, consume `plan.Plan`, and generate embedded `app.RuntimePlan` metadata directly.

Known limits:

- v2 doctor uses a synthetic provider registry for static validation. It cannot fully validate provider package implementation details unless a provider is linked into a generated sidecar or described by future provider manifests.
- Multiple artifacts are not fully orchestrated by `xgoja build`. The first binary-style artifact controls the current build target.
- Provider package import path and Go module path are inferred when a provider does not specify replacement/version metadata.

## Migration policy

Legacy v1 specs remain supported as migration input for `xgoja migrate-spec`.
New examples and docs should use `schema: xgoja/v2`. Normal command paths use
the v2 planner and runtime-plan model.

Use:

```bash
xgoja migrate-spec -f xgoja.yaml --out xgoja.v2.yaml
```

Then validate:

```bash
xgoja doctor -f xgoja.v2.yaml
```
